 a brainfuck interpreter featuring an endless tape in both directions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

etbi can interpret brainfuck source files with an endless tape of
cells with the size of a char, initially set to 0. Use it with `etbi
FILE`, or run one of the built-in examples with `etbi -e NAME`. You
can always get help with `etbi --help`.

etbi implements a few simple optimizations:
- Movement contraction: multiple movement instructions following
  each other are added together to one instruction with an argument.
- Alteration contraction: multiple alteration instructions following
  each other are added together to one instruction with an argument.
- Clear loop optimization: loops which can only end with the current
  cell ending up empty such as '[-]' are converted to a single clear
  instruction which sets the current cell to 0.
- Scan loop optimization: loops which are scanning all cells in a
  direction until they find one set to 0, such as '[>]' are converted
  to a single instruction which uses memchr or memrchr to find one
  faster.

To install etbi simply run `./configure && make && sudo make install`.
